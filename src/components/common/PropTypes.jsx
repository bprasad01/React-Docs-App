              PropTypes are simply a mechanism that ensures that the passed
              value is of the correct datatype. This makes sure that we donâ€™t
              receive an error at the very end of our app by the console which
              might not be easy to deal with.

              The most basic way we can check a prop's type is by checking if it
              falls under the category of primitive types in JavaScript, such as
              a boolean, string, object, and so on.

              sx={{ marginTop: "10%", lineHeight: "45px", color: "#2a9d8f" }}
            >
              Below is the list of all data types that are considered primitive
              or the basic ones with their classes that we can use to check
              props.{" "}

                height: 233,
                width: 350,
                maxHeight: { xs: 233, md: 167 },
                maxWidth: { xs: 350, md: 250 },
              }}
              alt="The house from the offer."

              Below is an example that shows us how to use these PropTypes for
              type checking in our app. As we discussed already, they are
              defined as objects with a key and a value pair where the key is
              the name of the object while value contains the classes which will
              be used for type checking.

            <Box
              component="img"
              sx={{
                height: 233,
                width: 350,
                maxHeight: { xs: 233, md: 167 },
                maxWidth: { xs: 350, md: 250 },
              }}
              alt="The house from the offer."
              src={Example}
